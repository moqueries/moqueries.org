## Installing moqueries
```shell
$ go install moqueries.org/cli/moqueries@latest
```

## Generating mocks
Mocks are generated by directly invoking `moqueries` from your terminal, but typically you want to capture the command in a `//go:generate` directive. The following directive (in a working example [here](https://github.com/moqueries/cli/blob/main/demo/demo.go#L11)) generates a mock for Go's ubiquitous [`io.Writer`](https://golang.org/pkg/io/#Writer) interface:
```go
//go:generate moqueries --import io Writer
```

Based on the name of the type being mocked, the mock is written to a file called [`moq_writer_test.go`](https://github.com/moqueries/cli/blob/main/demo/moq_writer_test.go) in the same directory containing this directive. Also note that since we presumably didn't put this directive in Go's standard library `io` package, we have to include a `--import io` option so that Moqueries can find the type.

Generating mocks for function types is just as easy. In the same example ([a few lines further down](https://github.com/moqueries/cli/blob/main/demo/demo.go#L13-L17)), we put a Go generate directive directly above the type definition (the best place for the directive unless you are mocking third-party types):
```go
//go:generate moqueries IsFavorite

type IsFavorite func(n int) bool
```
